// Enums for Vehicles

// creating an enum for vehicle so we can cotagorize differnt vehicles
enum Vehicles {
	cars,
	trucks,
	motorcycles,
	busses,
}

// logs one enum
console.log(Vehicles.cars); // 0
// we are just cotagorizing differnt vehicles not added value yet & logs the first enum which resulting in 0 because enum starts from 0 by default & rest incrementing by 1
